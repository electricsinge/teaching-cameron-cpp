//the MOST IMPORTANT THING IN C++ TO KNOW IS IT IS A 1 LINE LANGUAGE
//sure you might see lines to the side of this, but if i delete the lines, it will work just fine
//this means add a semicolon after doing [most] things

//you comment the same in js and c++(with two slashes)

/*And if you want a multi-line comment start the comment with '/*' and end with '* and then a frontwards slash(I cant do it here because otherwise it will end this comment)

you comment like you comment in js (i think)*/



#include <iostream>
//iostream is input-output so you kinda need to add that to the beggining of your code to do almost anything

#include <string>
//this is required to use the string variable type, which you will learn about later


int(main)//int main is not declaring a variable it is showing what the main function is
{
int examplevariable=50;
//declare a variable like this
//int stands for intenger
//intenger is a variable type, which you need to declare a variable
//other variable types are booleans(which is written as bool), string, (but you need to add #include <string> to the beginning to use it)

//now lets put this to practice :)

string examplestring="";
std::cout<<"hi";
std::cin>>examplestring;
//in C++ the user can write in the console by default
//that means that if i write yo to respond to hi written by std::cout, std::cin(pronounced sine) will put "yo" in a variable
}
